# simple_screen_app

Project #1: 
Created a flutter app with yellow background, a Name input, 4 switches and 3 sliders. and finally a "Done" text button.
The Name input needs to be filled, the 1st and 3rd switches needs to be turned on and the 3 sliders needs to be set at values 30, 70 and 50, respectively.
After these requirements are met, the Done button will display an alert, saying "All Done", and a "Done" button to dismiss it. 
If ANY of these requirements are NOT met, the "Done" text button will display an alert, saying "Requirements not met", and a "Done" button to dismiss it.
